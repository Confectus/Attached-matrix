# Inverse_matrix

All the comments in the program are in Spanish, but you can traslate them easily.

The process used for the calculus of the inverse matrix is: Inverse_matrix=Transposed_attached_matriz/Determinant

//Attached_matrix:
Basically, the program makes a travel for each position of the matrix. In each position it makes a new travel. Then, it compares the positions. If the positions are different the data is saving in the cofactor matrix. A function calculates the determinant of the cofactor matriz and saves the result in the attached matrix. 

//Transposed_attached_matrix:
A loop "for" is used for interchange the rows and columns respectively.

//Determinant:
Sarrus method is used for calculating the determinant of the input matrix.
